Tab: Developmental time

This is the developmental time (from egg to adult) of Mastrus ridens at 8 different rearing temperatures: 11, 15, 18, 21, 22, 24, 27 and 30Å∞C. After emergence I determined the sex of the adult (M or F) and measured its size (hind tibia length mm). 


We want to determine:
1.	The mean (Å±SE) development time (days) of M and Fs at each rearing temperature
2.	Is there a significant difference in adult size at different rearing temperatures? M and F data analysed separately. Then if no difference, analyse together. 


Tab: Developmental rate

The developmental rate is the reciprocal of the development time in the previous tab (i.e. 1/ developmental time). 
You developed some graphs with thresholds last year Non-linear fit using original Logan model and Non-linear fit using Lactin modified Logan model. These will need to be modified with the additional data at 11 and 30Å∞C

We want to estimate :
1.	The optimal, lower and upper development thresholds for Mastrus ridens 

The thresholds and regression will need to be calculated with the actual temperature readings given in the spreadsheet (second column). 


Tab: Emergence

This is the number of Mastrus ridens live adults that emerged from the cocoons at the  different rearing temperatures: 11, 15, 18, 21, 22, 24, 27 and 30Å∞C. 
CM= Codling moth rep number within each temperature. 
Total number of cocoons= Total number of Mastrus cocoons found on that CM.
Emerged adults= The number of Mastrus adults that emerged from that group of  cocoons.
Unemerged larva= The number of cocoons with unemerged Mastrus larvae.
Unemerged pupae or adults= The number of cocoons with unemerged Mastrus pupae or adults.

We want to determine:

1.	The emergence rates at the different temperatures. Proportion of cocoons emerging as adults 
2.	Is there a significant difference in adult emergences rates at different rearing temperatures? 


Tab: Adult Emergence

This is the time (days) to adult emergence of Mastrus ridens, initially reared at 22Å∞C for 14 days, then at 1 of 9 different rearing temperatures: 7, 11, 15, 18, 21, 22, 24, 27  and 30Å∞C. After emergence I determined the sex of the adult (M or F) and measured its size (hind tibia length). 

We want to determine:
3.	The mean (Å±SE) time (days) to adult emergence of M and Fs at each rearing temperature.
4.	Is there a significant difference in adult size at different rearing temperatures? M and F data analysed separately. Then if no difference, analyse together. 


Any questions, just give me a yell. Thanks again!

Tab: Female longevity with no hosts

This is the longevity of females provided with 4 different diets: No
water or diet, Water only, Undiluted honey & water, Honey agar
diet. These females werent provided with any hosts to parasitise
(codling moth larvae)

We want to determine: 
1. The mean (Å±SE) longevity (days) of females provided with the
different diets.

                       Diet      mean       sem  N

2. Is there a significant difference in longevity when provided with
the different diets?

Comparing No diet or water  with  Water only

1 No diet or water 5.392157 0.1880309 51
2       Water only 6.196078 0.1899837 51

water makes a tiny but significant difference. P = 0.00333

Agar makes a highly significant difference to longevity (P << 0.001)


3.	Does female size effect longevity? (i.e. Do larger females live longer?)

No: F = 0.0669; df = 1, 201; P = 0.7961

Tab: Female longevity with hosts

This is the longevity of females (virgin vs mated) provided with 3
different diets: Water only, Undiluted honey & water, Honey agar
diet. These females were provided with hosts to parasitise (codling
moth larvae)

We want to determine: 

1. The mean (Å±SE) longevity (days) of females (virgin vs mated
females) provided with the different diets.

2. Is there a significant difference in longevity of females (virgin

Anova shows no significant differece between mated and virgin.
Virgin v mated, non-significant difference (P = 0.538)

No diet very obviously different, so looking at other two:

Honey w/wo agar quite different - P = 0.01253


3. Is there a significant difference in the number of offspring
produced by females (virgin vs mated females) when provided with the
