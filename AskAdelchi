Hello Adelchi,

I see that's doing something rather less involved than what I had in
mind.  Perhaps I misunderstood what selm does.  

My aim was to get a more plausible fit to the pink and blue points in
the attached PDF, in particular where they meet the x-axis.  The
custom in that line of research is to extrapolate the linear fit
(thick lines) which is ignoring a lot of available information.  While
that might be sufficient for the low temperature end, the high
temperature end is sometimes important.

The shape of the density of a skewed-normal or -t looks more realistic
and I figured it would be possible to obtain a fit using the selm
function.  I thought it would be similar to obtaining predictions from
a Poisson GLM using the model coefficients. Is that possible?
