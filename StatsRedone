John,

I've done what might keep them happy.  I found a lot of degrees of
freedom information which I couldn't think of a non-cluttering way to
present. There's typically between 100 annd 110 degrees of freedom
which are used in the t-statistic probability calculations.  When they
get that high, it makes sodd all difference.



Statistical methods

The numbers of parasitoid eggs laid on paralysed larvae of each
non-target species, and survival to adult, were compared with those on
codling moth larvae. A negative binomial model from the MASS package
(Venables and Ripley 2002) with R (R Development Core Team 2011) was
chosen for its ability to estimate the extent of substantial
overdispersion. 

Sex ratios of emerging adults were compared with what
would be expected in a population of equal occurrence of males and
females using the stats R package function prop.test(). 

The standard R generalised linear model (GLM) was used with the
default gaussian link to compare the sizes of adults that developed on
non-target larvae with those from codling moth larvae, allowing for a
difference between male and female.  An anova of the GLM showed no
substantial effect of sex on the size of the adults (F=1.5125,
df=1,100, p=0.2217).  Consequently, the model was simplified to test
if M. ridens that emerged from non-target species were smaller than
those from codling moth.

Other paper:


The pre-contact and examination times were analysed to ascertain which
were different from the corresponding ones for the empty tissue.
Coefficients from a simple linear model in R (R Development Core Team)
were obtained and the probabilities of obtaining each of them if the
larvae or pupae were from a population which exhibited no difference
from empty tissue were calculated.

The TukeyHSD() from the stats R package was used to group species.
The function makes adjustment to the critical significant difference
to allow for the fact that multiple comparisons are being made and the
substantial imbalance in the number of individuals in the species
studied.

Though numbers in Ovipositor are not independent of those in Tap, etc,
that fact matters not since the non-independent numbers are never
compared with one another.  Each time the comparison is with the
corresponding response for the "control" species.  Only 4 numbers are
analysed in any one p-value calculation.  The calculation is done
separately for each stage in the Oviposition process.

It will be quite different from the Chisquare test particularly with
small numbers and we have a lot of those.  IMHO, the only one of
relevance is the Oviposition lot and they're always clear cut, so even
if you wanted to make an adjustment (which I suspect they might
claim), one can simply adjust the level of alpha which won't be very
remarkable.  Someone might get interested in the finer details of
what's involved in the Oviposition process and *might* find the
intervening stages interesting.

Binomial GLMs would use a Chisquare approximation in their tests which
would be inappropriate when such small numbers are often observed
(fewer than 5).  Instead Fisher's Exact test has been used to compare
the ratios of the number of insects that displayed the specific
behaviours.
