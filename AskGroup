Getting predictions for skewed t-distribution


The data I have is Development rate (from 0.009 to 0.05) as a function
of temperature (10 to 30).

After a lot of fiddling with initial values, I managed to make a
non-linear fit involving exponential increases and decreases.  But it
looks overly complicated and biologically unconvincing in part.  The
general form of a skewed t-distribution looks more appropriate so I
tried an R package which produced these so-called Direct Parameter
coefficients:

(Intercept.DP)              T          omega          alpha             nu 
  -0.015895099    0.002689226    0.002306132   -5.660870446    1.473210455 

I wish to get predictions of Development for values of T between 10
and 32 but I can't figure out how to use those coefficients.  The
first two are intercept and slope, while 'nu' is the effective degrees
of freedom.  The other two relate to scale and slant in ways I've been
unable to establish.

There are sometimes alternative Cumulative Parameter coefficients
availablle (but not in this case).  For the corresponding skew-Normal
(were it appropriate) they would be:

 (Intercept.CP)               T            s.d.          gamma1 
-0.018365754902  0.002562849559  0.004336585489 -0.928787906259 

It has no nu parameter since it has infinite degrees of freedom.  That
much is clear but how s.d. and gamma1 relate to omega and alpha I
can't decypher from the dense documentation.  Maybe it's unnecessary
to know in order to get the predictions.

With an ordinary linear model or glm, even without a prediction
method, it's fairly simple to get predictions from a range of values
of the independent variable/s.  For a skewed-t it's evidently less
straightforward. 

If anyone has had experience with such, I'd appreciate some pointers.
