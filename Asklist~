Getting predictions for skewed t-distribution


I have a small dataframe xxF, a summary of which looks like this:

> summary(xxF)
       T              Dev          
 Min.   :10.44   Min.   :0.008929  
 1st Qu.:10.44   1st Qu.:0.012048  
 Median :18.61   Median :0.031250  
 Mean   :17.87   Mean   :0.028286  
 3rd Qu.:22.24   3rd Qu.:0.041667  
 Max.   :30.37   Max.   :0.050000  


I managed to make a non-linear fit after a lot of fiddling with
initial values but it looks overly complicated and biologically
unconvincing in part.  The general form of a skewed t-distribution
looks more appropriate so I tried selm from the SN package thus:


>  selmFt <- with(xxF, selm(Dev ~ T, family = "ST", method="MPLE"))
>  coef(selmFt, param.type="DP")
(Intercept.DP)              T          omega          alpha             nu 
  -0.015895099    0.002689226    0.002306132   -5.660870446    1.473210455 

I wish to get predictions for values of T between 10 and 32 but I can't
figure out how to use those coefficients.

With an linear model or glm, even without a prediction method, it's
fairly simple to get predictions from a range of values of the
independent variable/s.  For a skewed-t it's evidently less
straightforward.  Does it have to be done using CP type parameters?
